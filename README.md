# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
This is a repository intended to showcase a multitude of data analytics or data science projects accomplished by me (Adrian Paul C. Galiste), an Industrial Engineering graduate from Saint Louis University, with a strong passion for data science.

Throughout my studies in university, I developed an interest in statistics --- specifically statistical tools and visualization charts. I disovered data science as a profession through a seminar hosted by my department, this was the start of a long journey of learning about data science fundamentals. Now with a strong foundation on the fundamentals, I am now ready to use data science tools (SQL, Tableau, Python, Excel, etc.) to accomplish mock projects or help solve problems faced by companies in the real world. 

I am committed to finishing multiple data analysis or data science projects to prove that I can be a valuable asset to the company by providing data-driven insights which could be used by the company to make effective decisions or to avoid dire financial consequences.
