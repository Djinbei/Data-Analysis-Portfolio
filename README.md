# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Hi. I am Adrian Paul C. Galiste, an Industrial Engineering graduate of Saint Louis University with a strong passion for data analytics, specifically analyzing and deriving insights from data that are relevant to my personal and professional endeavors. 

I started to develop an interest in Statistics and Statistical tools during my second year of university. This was also the time that I discovered the existence of Data Scientist as a profession through a seminar, the experience inspired me to learn about Data Science fundamentals. After three months, I was able to build a strong knowledge foundation on Data Science concepts and tools which will help me accomplish projects and solve problems using data.

This portfolio contains my data analysis projects. Each project uses a different combination of tools such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Python, R, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Azure, Oracle, and many more.

I am committed to finishing multiple data analysis or data science projects to prove that I can be a valuable asset to the company by providing data-driven insights which could be used by the company to make effective decisions and avoid dire financial consequences.
