# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## Adrian Paul C. Galiste

Industrial Engineer with a strong passion for data analysis, specifically deriving insights from data that serves to improve processes and create solutions to problems. During my second year at university, I started to develop an interest on Statistics and how it can be used as a tool or solution to different types of problems. This was also the time I discovered Data Science as a career path. Three months after, I built a strong Data Science foundation that I could use to build projects and for problems that can be solved using data. 

However, I discovered the "Data Analyst" profession recently, which is a more accessible field for entry level data practitioners. With this, I plan to start off my career as a Data Analyst, first building my technical and practical knowledge through building data analysis projects focused on different fields and accomplishing data analysis certifications.

This portfolio contains projects focused on building my knowledge and skills to become an effective Data Analyst. I plan to use different combinations of tools such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Python, R, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Azure, Oracle, etc. for each project to widen my technical toolset.

I am committed to finishing multiple data analysis or data science projects to prove that I can be a valuable asset to the company by providing data-driven insights which could be used by the company to make effective decisions and avoid dire financial consequences.
