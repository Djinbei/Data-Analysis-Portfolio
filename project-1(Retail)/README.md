# Retail Operations Analytics: Gaining Insights on Sales, Customer Behavior, and Inventory Through Data Analysis

## About 

This project looks at a retail company's dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data). I aim to derive relevant sales, customer, and inventory insights from the data to give sound recommendations to the company which will help them make the right decisions for the company's operations, marketing and sales, and inventory. The dataset includes Transaction ID, Date, CustomerID, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Amount. The standard process data analysis process is followed, particularly data sourcing, data transformation (remove missing entries and duplicates, correcting data format, etc.), exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.
