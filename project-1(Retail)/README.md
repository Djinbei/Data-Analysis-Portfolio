# Project 1 
# A Beginner Project: Data Analysis of a Retail Company

## About 
This is my first data analysis project, therefore I expect it to be full of gaps and lack of direction. Nevertheless, I will try my best to apply the concepts I have learned from school such as *Exploratory Data Analysis*, *data cleaning*, and *data visualization*. This project will serve as my stepping stone towards learning more and improving my technical and practical data analysis knowledge.

This project involves looking at retail data procured from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data), performing data analysis through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization to gain relevant insights and recommend action plans that could be applied to other retail stores that offer a wide variety of products. The dataset includes Transaction ID, Date, CustomerID, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Amount. The standard steps or process of effective data analysis is conducted, loading the data, cleaning the data (ensuring there's no missing entries, setting data points in their right format, etc.), analyzing the data through descriptive statistics, and then providing visual information through charts and graphs to stakeholders to aid them in making effective decisions through the use of data.
