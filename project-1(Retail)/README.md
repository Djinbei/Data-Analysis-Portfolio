For a retail company, sales and inventory are the most critical indicators of success, both heavily influced by customers' needs and preferences.  Therefore, A clear understanding of their sales performance, customer preferences, product overview, and inventory management is very important to ensure sustainable operations and overall profitability.  

This project looks at a retail company's dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data). I aim to derive relevant sales, customer, and inventory insights from the data to give sound recommendations to the company which will help them make the right decisions for the company's operations, marketing and sales, and inventory. The dataset includes Transaction ID, Date, CustomerID, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Amount. The standard process data analysis process is followed, particularly data sourcing, data transformation (remove missing entries and duplicates, correcting data format, etc.), exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

## Conclusion

The company's sales are driven solely by Adults and Young Adults. The analysis of monthly trends and patterns show company sales peak during Q4 and dip during Q3. Insights into Gender and Age Group preference show that Electronics and Clothing are the company's top product lines, with Beauty products being the lowest contributor in sales despite having the highest average price per unit, highlighting the need to invest more resources in promoting Beauty products and making them more affordable and visible to make it more appealing to different customer demographics. Therefore, integrating product bundles, promoting free samples of products, leveraging resources used in peak periods to improve dry sales periods, redesigning outlet stores, and keeping a safe amount of units stored and ready every month can attract other cusotmer segments such as Children and Seniors, maintain or improve each product categories sales performance, optimize inventory management, and improve company branding. These improvements will then increase company profit by 3 to 5 percent.
