# Project 1 
# A Beginner Project: Data Analysis of a Retail Company

## About 
The project involves looking at retail data procured from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data), performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain relevant insights and produce action plans that could be applied to other retail stores that also offer a wide variety of products. The dataset includes Transaction ID, Date, CustomerID, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Amount. The standard steps or process of effective data analysis is conducted, loading the data, cleaning the data (ensuring there's no missing entries, setting data points in their right format, etc.), analyzing the data through descriptive statistics, and then providing visual information through charts and graphs to stakeholders to aid them in making effective decisions through the use of data.
