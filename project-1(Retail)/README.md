# Retail Operations Analytics: Gaining Insights on Sales, Customer Behavior, and Inventory Through Data Analysis

## About 

Sales and Inventory are the most critical indicators of success for a Retail Company, both heavily influenced by customers' needs and preferences.  It is therefore important for the company to understand their Sales Performance, Customers, Products, and Inventory Management to maintain or improve their operations and overall profitability.  

This project looks at a retail company's dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data). I aim to derive relevant sales, customer, and inventory insights from the data to give sound recommendations to the company which will help them make the right decisions for the company's operations, marketing and sales, and inventory. The dataset includes Transaction ID, Date, CustomerID, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Amount. The standard process data analysis process is followed, particularly data sourcing, data transformation (remove missing entries and duplicates, correcting data format, etc.), exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

## Conclusion

The company's sales are driven solely by Adults and Young Adults. The analysis of monthly trends and patterns show sales peaked during the fourth quarter of the year and dipped during the third quarter. The analysis of customer demographics strongly indicate Electronics and Clothing products as the company's top product lines. Beauty products fall behind the two products signficantly, being the lowest contributor in sales despite having the highest average price per unit.

## Recommendations

It is therefore highly recommended for the retail company to invest more resources towards promotion of Beauty products through specific marketing strategies such as product bundles, free samples and placing beauty products into the recommended products section of the company's website, redesigning layout of outlet stores to improve its visibility, accessibility, and appeal to customers such as introducing a specific beauty product section in an easily accesible and visible area of the outlet store/s. Leveraging peak period resources to improve dry sales periods will help achieve stable sales performance for the whole business year. Last but not least, keeping a standard amount of 250 - 300 units every month prevents occurrences of stockouts and ensure safety buffer stocks for unexpected high product demand.

## Business Impact

Following the recommendations will most likely result to increased customer transactions, maintained or improved product sales performance, optimized inventory management system, and a more reliable company branding. All of which can increase company profitability by 3 to 5 percent.
