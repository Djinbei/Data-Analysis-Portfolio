## Data Cleaning
To make sure that the data is accurate, and therefore, reliable. I cleaned the data using Google Sheets by:
* Setting proper format for all categories (e.g. date format for "Date", currency format for "Pricer Per unit" and "Total Amount")
* Used a formula to count for missing information (cells that have no values called null cells) Refer to this image
* Made use of the IF and RIGHT function in Google Sheets to concatenate the numbers in "CustomerID" and compare it with the Transaction ID to eliminate any typographical errors. Click this for the before data cleaning reference and this for the after data cleaning reference.
